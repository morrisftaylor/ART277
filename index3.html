<h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>
<p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought
me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has
given me a unique learning experience.</p>

<p>At five,I <u style="color: blue;"><b>marveled</b></u> at the Eiffel Tower of the city of Light.When I was eight,I stood in the heart Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons,than glided down Venetian waterway on sleek gondolas. At thirteen I saw ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked<img src="IM.jpg" style="margin:right15px;margin:10px;width:100%; height:190px; float:left;">
along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-years-old stones were still in place just as it is in. <u style="color:blue;"><b> Starz University</b></u>.
</p> 
<p>It was throught exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.</p>
<p>It began with french,which taught me the important about of pronunciation.I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des pyramides was.Bit when I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides,with more accent on the A,she looked at me bewildered.</p>
<p>In the eight grade,I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of it's similarities with Enghlish through cognates.Baseball in Spanish,for example,béisbol,which looks different but sounds nearly the same.This was incredible to me as it make speech and comprehension more fluid,and even today I find out the cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. <u style="color:blue;"><b>Send Us Email</b></u></p>
<p>Then,in high school,I developed enthusiasm for Chinese.As I studied Chinese at my school,I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from the character,the meaning is lost.I loved how longs words were formed by combining simple character,so Huô() meaning fire and Shān() meaning mountain can be joined to create Huôshān() which means volcano.I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.</p>
